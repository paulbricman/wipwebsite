      Dear visitor,
    </p>
    <p class="letter">
      For centuries, people have been building machines to fulfill their needs and fuel their fascination. For most of this period, the latest technology was to be found no further than in clockwork automata – intricate mechanisms portraying <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_1888-1201-122">people farming the land</a>, <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_1866-1030-1">ships sailing the seas</a>, or <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/tipus-tiger">animals feasting on prey</a>. Being extremely repetitive, they were the archetype of predictability and perpetuity – literal clockwork.

      Halfway through the twentieth century, however, the non-trivial challenge of reliably steering complex machinery towards certain behaviors and away from others was <a href="https://archive.org/details/norbert-wiener-cybernetics/page/177/mode/2up?q=%22In+all+these+stories+the+point+is+that%22">recognized</a> by the early pioneers of cybernetics (literally, <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/cybernetics"><i>steersman</i></a>). Today, the need for finding ways of skillfully wielding computation is <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/">more pressing than ever</a>, given the colossal scale of our latest creations. The space you just stumbled upon is dedicated precisely to the search of such techniques. I'm pleased to have you around.
